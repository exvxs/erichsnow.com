            <li>If the FBI truly wanted a one-time solution, they would be looking for ways to exploit Syed Farook's endpoint security rather than seeking a legal solution. <i>Ergo</i> the FBI is not looking for a one-time solution.</li>

            <li>justice jackson's dissent in the immigration case <i>shaughnessy v. mezei</i> is refreshing. so often judges don't move beyond dry legal diction; it's a juris doctor, we should be a little more philosophical making our points, especially when technically-correct application of the law leads to a patently wrong result.</li>
